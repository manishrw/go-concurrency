## Module Structure

Each module follows this structure:
- **`main.go`** - Contains exercises and examples
- **Instructions** - Detailed learning objectives
- **Examples** - Working code examples
- **Exercises** - Hands-on implementation tasks

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.19 or later
- Basic understanding of Go syntax
- Familiarity with basic programming concepts

## Useful Commands

```bash
# Run race detection
go test -race -v

# Run benchmarks
go test -bench=. -benchmem

# Profile CPU usage
go tool pprof

# Trace execution
go tool trace

# Check for goroutine leaks
go test -race -v -timeout=30s
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always use race detection** during development
2. **Implement proper error handling** in concurrent code
3. **Use context for cancellation** and timeouts
4. **Avoid goroutine leaks** with proper cleanup
5. **Test concurrent code thoroughly** with different scenarios
6. **Profile and benchmark** your concurrent code
7. **Document concurrency assumptions** and invariants
